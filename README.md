# Guess-My-Number-Game
My first simple project with JavaScript.

A game that produces a secret number between 1 and 20 and let you guess it. Your initial and heighest score is 20, Everytime you input a wrong number, The score decreases by one until you guess the right number and win or the score keeps decreasing to zero and you lose the game. You can click 'Again' for another try or for a higher score.
